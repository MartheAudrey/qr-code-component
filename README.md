## My process

I pictured in my head the structure the QR code must have to look as the design given and applied it in the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

While working on this project is responsiveness. I was able to make a component that adapts to various sizes of screens.

```
 @media((max-width : 1025px) and (min-width : 375px)){
      main{
        width: 80%;
        height: 100vw;
      }
      .image-container{
        height: 60%;
      }
      .text-container h2{
        font-size: 5vw;
      }
      .text-container p{
        font-size: 4vw;
      }
    }
```


### Continued development

I intent to get better in the areas of responsiveness, accessibility and SEO.

### Useful resources

- [CSS The object-fit Property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.asp) - This helped me to make sure the QR code image fit my container.
